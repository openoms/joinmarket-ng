## Wallet

### HD Structure

HD path: `m/84'/coin_type'/mixdepth'/chain/index` (BIP84 P2WPKH)

`coin_type` is `0` on mainnet and `1` on testnet/signet/regtest.

- **Mixdepths**: 5 isolated accounts (0-4)
- **Chains**: External (0) for receiving, Internal (1) for change
- **Index**: Sequential address index

### BIP39 Passphrase Support

JoinMarket NG supports the optional BIP39 passphrase ("25th word"):

**Important Distinction:**

- **File encryption password** (`--password`): Encrypts mnemonic file with AES
- **BIP39 passphrase** (`--bip39-passphrase`): Used in seed derivation per BIP39

The passphrase is provided when **using** the wallet, not when importing:

```bash
# Import only stores mnemonic (no passphrase)
jm-wallet import --words 24

# Passphrase provided at usage time:
jm-wallet info --prompt-bip39-passphrase
jm-wallet info --bip39-passphrase "my phrase"
BIP39_PASSPHRASE="my phrase" jm-wallet info
```

**Security Notes:**

- Empty passphrase (`""`) is valid and different from no passphrase
- Passphrase is case-sensitive and whitespace-sensitive
- **Not read from config file** to prevent accidental exposure

### UTXO Selection

**Taker Selection:**

- **Normal**: Minimum UTXOs to cover `cj_amount + fees`
- **Sweep** (`--amount=0`): All UTXOs, zero change (best privacy)

```bash
jm-taker coinjoin --amount=0 --mixdepth=0 --destination=INTERNAL
```

**Maker Merge Algorithms:**

| Algorithm | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| `default` | Minimum UTXOs only |
| `gradual` | Minimum + 1 small UTXO |
| `greedy` | All UTXOs from mixdepth |
| `random` | Minimum + 0-2 random UTXOs |

```bash
jm-maker start --merge-algorithm=greedy
```

Privacy tradeoff: More inputs = faster consolidation but reveals UTXO clustering.

### Backend Systems

**Descriptor Wallet Backend (Recommended):**

- Method: `importdescriptors` + `listunspent` RPC
- Requirements: Bitcoin Core v24+
- Storage: ~900 GB + small wallet file
- Sync: Fast after initial descriptor import
- **Smart Scan**: Scans ~1 year of blocks initially, full rescan in background

Trade-off: Addresses stored in Core wallet file - never use with third-party node.

**Bitcoin Core Backend (Legacy):**

- Method: `scantxoutset` RPC (no wallet required)
- Requirements: Bitcoin Core v30+
- Sync: Slow (~90s per scan on mainnet)

Useful for one-off operations without persistent tracking.

**Neutrino Backend:**

- Method: BIP157/158 compact block filters
- Requirements: [neutrino-api server](https://github.com/m0wer/neutrino-api)
- Storage: ~500 MB
- Sync: Minutes instead of days

**Decision Matrix:**

- Use DescriptorWallet if: You run a full node (recommended)
- Use BitcoinCore if: Simple one-off UTXO queries
- Use Neutrino if: Limited storage, fast setup needed

**Neutrino Broadcast Strategy:**

Neutrino's broadcast and verification behavior depends on whether the
connected `neutrino-api` server exposes the watched-only mempool
tracker (`mempool_enabled: true` on `/v1/status`).

| Policy | With mempool tracker | Without mempool tracker (legacy) |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| `SELF` | Broadcast via own backend, verify via mempool, then confirmation | Broadcast via own backend (always verifiable on chain) |
| `RANDOM_PEER` | Try makers sequentially, verify via mempool, fall back to self | Forced to all-makers fan-out (see below) |
| `MULTIPLE_PEERS` | Broadcast to N makers simultaneously (default), verify via mempool | Forced to all-makers fan-out |
| `NOT_SELF` | Try makers only, verify via mempool, no fallback | Forced to all-makers fan-out, no fallback |

When mempool access is unavailable (legacy server, or operator opt-out
via `bitcoin.neutrino_include_mempool = false`), all non-`SELF`
policies fan out the `!push` to every available maker simultaneously.
This avoids the privacy-leaking self-broadcast fallback when an
individual maker is offline (issue #482); confirmation is then
established via block-based UTXO lookups.

When the tracker is available, neutrino behaves like the descriptor
wallet backend: it can confirm that a maker actually broadcast the
transaction and short-circuit the fan-out. `jm-wallet info
--extended` also annotates addresses with `(unconfirmed)` for
mempool UTXOs.

### Periodic Wallet Rescan

Both maker and taker support periodic rescanning:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `rescan_interval_sec` | 600 | How often to rescan |
| `post_coinjoin_rescan_delay` | 60 | Delay after CoinJoin (maker) |

**Maker:** After CoinJoin, rescans to detect balance changes and update offers automatically.

**Taker:** Rescans between schedule entries to track pending confirmations.

### Multiple Wallets in One Data Directory

JoinMarket-NG records every CoinJoin (as taker or maker) in a single
`coinjoin_history.csv` file inside the data directory. Each row is tagged with
the BIP32 master fingerprint (`wallet_fingerprint`, first 4 bytes of `m/0`),
so commands like `jm-wallet history` and `jm-wallet info` filter to the
correct wallet automatically when a mnemonic is supplied.

Recommended practice is still to give each wallet its own data directory via
the `JOINMARKET_DATA_DIR` env variable or the `--data-dir` flag. This keeps
config, logs, and the order registry per-wallet, and avoids cases where one
wallet sees pending entries created by another (still tracked correctly, just
visually noisy).

Legacy entries written before per-wallet tagging have an empty fingerprint and
are hidden from filtered views; pass `--all-wallets` to `jm-wallet history` to
see them.

### Viewing the Seed (`jm-wallet showseed`)

`jm-wallet showseed -f <mnemonic-file>` prints the BIP39 seed words after
prompting for the password (when the file is encrypted). The command is
intentionally guarded by a `y/N` confirmation; pass `--yes` to skip it in
scripts. Seed words give full control of the funds: only run the command in
a private setting, and never paste the output anywhere.
